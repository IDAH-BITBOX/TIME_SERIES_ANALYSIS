# TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Effective Method for analyzing Time Series Data

## 1. Bursty Process vs. Random Process
There is a generalized queuing process, using a parameter ![수식](\alpha) in Barabasi's Burst paper ("The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics, 2005").

![수식](\alpha=0) : Control Parameter of Priority array's components' exponent. (like as fitness of node or task.)

![수식](\alpha=0) : Random Process.
![수식](\alpha>0) : Bursty Process. (Or Deterministic Process)


## 2. Record Statistics
