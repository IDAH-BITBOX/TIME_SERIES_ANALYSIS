# TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Effective Method for analyzing Time Series Data

## 1. Bursty Process vs. Random Process
There is a generalized queuing process, using a parameter ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/AAsLZeP) in Barabasi's Burst paper.
("The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics, 2005").

 * ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/AAsLZeP): Control Parameter of Priority array's components' exponent. (like as fitness of node or task.)

 * $ \alpha=0 $ : Random Process.
 * $ \alpha>0 $  : Bursty Process. (Or Deterministic Process)


## 2. Record Statistics
