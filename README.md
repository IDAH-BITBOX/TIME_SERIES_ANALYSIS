# TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Effective Method for analyzing Time Series Data

## 1. Bursty Process vs. Random Process
There is a generalized queuing process, using a parameter ![math]() in Barabasi's Burst paper.
("The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics, 2005").

 * ![math]() : Control Parameter of Priority array's components' exponent. (like as fitness of node or task.)

 * ![math]() : Random Process.
 * ![math]()   : Bursty Process. (Or Deterministic Process)


## 2. Record Statistics
